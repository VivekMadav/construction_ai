- Real-time processing status
- Automatic element detection
- Confidence scores for each detection

**Say:** *"Here's where the magic happens. Upload any construction drawing, and our AI automatically detects walls, doors, windows, and other elements. Notice the confidence scores - our system tells you how certain it is about each detection."*

### **4. Element Detection Results (3 minutes)**
**Show:** Detected elements with bounding boxes

**Highlight:**
- 450mÂ² of walls detected (85% confidence)
- 24 doors identified (78% confidence)
- 36 windows found (81% confidence)
- 12 columns located (89% confidence)

**Say:** *"In just 30 seconds, we've identified what would take a QS professional 2-3 hours to measure manually. The confidence scores help you know which areas might need human review."*

### **5. Cost Calculation (3 minutes)**
**Action:** Generate cost analysis

**Show Cost Breakdown:**
- **Materials:** Â£45,000 (Concrete blocks, timber doors, etc.)
- **Labor:** Â£18,750 (Based on standard rates)
- **Equipment:** Â£4,500 (10% of materials)
- **Overhead:** Â£10,125 (15% of direct costs)
- **Total:** Â£78,375

**Say:** *"Our cost engine automatically calculates material costs, labor rates, equipment, and overhead. This gives you an instant estimate that's typically within 5-10% of final costs."*

### **6. Report Generation (2 minutes)**
**Action:** Generate detailed cost report

**Show Report Features:**
- Professional PDF output
- Cost breakdown by element type
- Material recommendations
- Carbon footprint calculations
- Value engineering suggestions

**Say:** *"Generate professional reports instantly. These can be sent directly to clients or used for tendering. Notice we also include carbon footprint data - increasingly important for sustainability requirements."*

### **7. API Demonstration (2 minutes)**
**Navigate to:** http://localhost:8000/docs

**Show API Endpoints:**
- GET /api/v1/projects - List all projects
- POST /api/v1/drawings/upload - Upload drawings
- GET /api/v1/analysis/project/{id}/costs - Get cost analysis

**Say:** *"The platform is built API-first, meaning it can integrate with your existing software. You can automate workflows and connect to your current systems."*
